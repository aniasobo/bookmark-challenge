# Bookmark challenge

You're going to build a bookmark manager. A bookmark manager is a website to maintain a collection of bookmarks (URLs). You can use it to save a webpage you found useful. You can add tags to the webpages you saved to find them later. You can browse bookmarks other users have added. You can comment on the bookmarks.

## Specifications

- [ ] Show a list of bookmarks
- [ ] Add new bookmarks
- [ ] Delete bookmarks
- [ ] Update bookmarks
- [ ] Comment on bookmarks
- [ ] Tag bookmarks into categories
- [ ] Filter bookmarks by tag
- [ ] Users are restricted to manage only their own bookmarks

## Approach

We broke the sepcifications down itno User stories and looked to implement each one before moving onto the next

### Show a list of bookmarks

```
As a user
So that I can see that I have no bookmarks
I want to open my bookmark manager and see that it is empty

As a user
So that I can see my bookmarks
I want to open my bookmark manager and see a list of bookmarks
```

We broke this specification into 2 user stories to make it clear the behaviour we expect to see both when there are and aren't any bookmarks.
